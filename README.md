# Software-Mystery-Box-Generator
A tool that makes a "mystery box" of 3 software.

# Usage
Run the "generate.bat" file - the tool will copy 3 random files to a folder, then compress it with 7z

"gen_debug.bat" just enables messages

# Note
For space reasons, you must supply your own software in the 3 cat (category) folders, then delete the demo files.
